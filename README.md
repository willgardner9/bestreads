# Bestreads

Bestreads is a web app that allows you to create a private list of books you want to read, books you have read, and set an annual reading challenge. I created it for my partner and I to use together - goodreads without the public social media. Bestreads is a React app with Next.js on the front end and supabase, an open-source PaaS, on the back end.
